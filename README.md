Copy the flask server folder to a directory on your Windows PC

Copy the contents of the Raspberry Pi folder to the home directory of your raspberry Pi

To start the system, first run the backend.py script and frontend.py python scripts located in the flask server folder. This will boot up the Web server

Then Run the raspberry pi.py script on the raspberry Pi.

Connect the DHT11 sensors and the pulse sensor following the references from the project summary report in the repository.

The measurements will be taken and transmitted to the Webserver on your PC.

You can view the sensor reading using 127.0.0.1:81/patient1 on your PC.
